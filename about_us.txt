MerchLab
Create. Customise. Deliver. 
BBBEE 
MerchLab makes branded merchandise simple, fast and accessible. Our goal is to revolutionise custom merchandise by removing unnecessary friction and giving small businesses the same merchandising power as big brands. We make it easy to create, customise and deliver quality merchandise to whomever, whenever, and to launch drop‑shipping stores effortlessly and hassle‑free. 


At the heart of MerchLab is our belief that technology should do the heavy lifting. Our 24/7 online platform, powered by agentic AI and smart automation, streamlines every step — from faster quotes and consistent follow‑ups to live order tracking — while people step in where judgment and nuance matter. We act as more than just a supplier; we are a strategic partner committed to enhancing your brand’s presence and impact. To support the operational and procurement needs of large corporations, we offer credit facilities (on application to qualifying clients) to ensure smooth financial transactions. 



Leadership 
MerchLab is led by Founder and Managing Director Anita Modi Mitchell, a tech‑first entrepreneur focused on using digital innovation to unlock commercial growth. With nearly two decades of experience in advertising and marketing, Anita has helped global and local brands connect more meaningfully with people and markets. 
She has guided businesses through brand repositioning, operational streamlining and the design of effective sales funnels that deepen customer engagement. This work has given her a practical, end‑to‑end view of how brand, communication and commercial strategy intersect — and how technology can bind them together. MerchLab is a direct continuation of this focus, turning cumbersome legacy operations into a responsive, data‑enabled growth channel for clients.

Investor 
Supporting this vision is our investor, Cassim Motala. Cassim has a long track record in investment, entrepreneurship and value creation. He started his career in the late 1990s with an internet gaming start‑up, helped build a global payments business and spent 16 years in Private Equity at RMB Ventures, where he was a dealmaker and later co‑head of the team. 
He served on the RMB Investment Committee, the RMB Management Board and several notable private equity boards. Cassim brings deep experience in building and scaling businesses, ensuring that MerchLab’s ambition is backed by strong commercial and governance foundations.

Behind the Scenes 
Behind the scenes, Anita is supported by an agentic team responsible for sales, customer service and AI‑enabled operations. 
Mia is our Customer Experience Manager. She is the friendly, professional voice you will meet on email, WhatsApp and outbound and inbound calls. Mia helps you understand product options, branding choices and timelines. She guides you through quotes, answers questions and keeps you updated on your order. When something is unclear or delayed, she explains what is happening and what will happen next. 
Together, the platform, Mia, Anita and Cassim share one simple mission: to make high‑quality branded merchandise easy to create, effortless to manage and genuinely useful in growing your brand.
