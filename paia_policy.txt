5. How to request access to records
The Act grants requesters access to records of a private body if such records are necessary for exercising or protecting their rights. Requests under the Act must follow the prescribed procedures and fees established by the Minister, which are periodically updated. The applicable forms and tariffs are detailed in the Act. The Information Regulator has revised the PAIA Guide, as mandated by Section 10(1) of PAIA, which was originally compiled by the SAHRC.  This Guide serves to inform individuals wishing to exercise their rights under PAIA and POPIA, specifically assisting data subjects in accessing their personal information under Section 23 of POPIA  

5.1 Request for access to a record To request access to a record, complete, available at the following link: Form 02.
 
Please ensure that the completed form:  
Contains enough information for the Information Officer to identify you, the requested records, and the form of access required.
Specifies your email address, postal address, or fax number.
Describes the right you seek to exercise or protect.  
Explains why you need the requested record to exercise or protect that right.  
Indicates any other method by which you would like to be informed of our decision, aside from written communication.  
Provides proof of the capacity in which you are making the request if you are doing so on behalf of someone else (we will determine if this proof is satisfactory). If you do not use the standard form, we may:  
Reject the request due to a lack of procedural compliance, or  
Refuse it if you do not provide sufficient information; or relay it. We strive to keep all data in our possession secure and up to date.  
 
5.2 Categories of requestors. The capacity under which a requester submits a request for records determines the category they fall into. The following is a non-exhaustive list of requesters:  
A data subject requesting information about themselves.  
A representative making a request on behalf of one or more data subjects.  
A third-party requesting information about a data subject.  
A public body requesting information in the public interest.   
 
5.3 Prescribed Fees When submitting a request for access to information, a request fee is required by law. The prescribed fees are outlined in the Fee Schedule, which can be accessed at the following link: PAIA Guide (Annexure B).   
If a request is granted and the time required to locate and prepare the record for disclosure exceeds the prescribed hours, an additional access fee may apply. All requests submitted under PAIA will be carefully evaluated. If access to records is approved, the method of access will be determined unless a specific format for receiving the information has been requested. The publication of this manual does not grant any rights to access information records, except as provided under PAIA.

Chapter 4 of the Act provides circumstances under which a request for access to records may/must be refused by MerchLab, which include:  
Mandatory protection of privacy of a third party who is a natural person;  
Mandatory protection of commercial information of a third party;  
Mandatory protection of certain confidential information of a third party;  
Mandatory protection of the safety of data subjects, and protection of property;  
Mandatory protection of records privileged from production in legal proceedings;  
Mandatory protection of research information of a third party, and protection of research information of MerchLab.   

The requester will be notified in writing whether their request has been approved or denied within 30 calendar days after receipt by MerchLab of the completed Request for Access Form. Should any record of MerchLab requested not be found or not exist, MerchLab will, by way of affidavit, notify the requester that it is not possible to give access to that particular record.   All requests for access to information should be made as per the procedure set out in this manual.

9. Remedies available on refusal of access
If a request for information is denied by the Deputy Information Officer, the applicant may appeal to the Information Officer by sending an email directly to them. The email should include the reason for the appeal. The decision made by the Information Officer will be final.   
If a request for information is denied and the requester is dissatisfied with the response, they must seek external remedies. In accordance with PAIA, if the requester or a third party disagrees with the Information Officer’s decision to withhold information, they may apply to a court for relief within 180 days of receiving the decision. Alternatively, the matter may be referred to the Information Regulator by completing the form on the following link: Form 05.

9.1 Records that cannot be found or do not exist  
If MerchLab has taken all reasonable steps to find a record and it is believed that the record either does not exist or cannot be found, the requester will be notified by way of an affidavit or affirmation. This will include the steps that were taken to try to locate the record.


10. Planned Transborder flows of personal information
MerchLab may, at times, transfer personal information outside of South Africa to various countries. However, we will only do so if those countries have privacy laws comparable to South Africa's or if the recipients can ensure the protection of personal information to the same standard that we uphold.

11. Third party information
If access is requested to a record that contains information about a third party, MerchLab is obliged to attempt to contact this third party to inform them of the request as soon as reasonably possible and within 30 days of receiving the request. This enables the third party the opportunity of responding by either consenting to the access or by providing reasons why the access should be denied which must be made in writing to the Information Officer within 30 days of being informed.  
Once a third-party has furnished reasons for the granting or denial of access, the Information Officer or their deputy will consider these reasons in determining whether access should be granted, or not, and must do so within 30 days after the third-party/s has been notified, unless a complaint has been lodged. The third-party must be notified of the final decision made.

12. Data security
MerchLab implements reasonable, appropriate, and adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal information, protecting it against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, disclosure, or unauthorised access.  

MerchLab regularly reviews its security controls and processes to maintain the safety of personal information. However, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that personal information has been accessed or acquired by unauthorised individuals, 

MerchLab will notify the Regulator and the affected data subject. This notification will not occur if the Regulator or a public body responsible for investigating offenses advises that notifying the data subject would hinder a criminal investigation.

13. Publication and revision history
