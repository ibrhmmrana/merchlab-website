# Case Study: MerchLab.io
## Agentic eCommerce and 24/7 AI Support Built by Sagentics

## The Client

**MerchLab (https://merchlab.io)** is a B2B merchandise and branding company serving small and medium-sized businesses. They needed to scale operations, improve customer experience, and keep support costs predictable without adding headcount.

---

## The Challenge

Growing businesses face a common squeeze: more orders, more customer questions, and more touchpoints (WhatsApp, email, phone) without a proportional budget for support staff. Manual processes and reactive support limit how fast they can grow. MerchLab wanted enterprise-grade automation and always-on customer support, delivered in a way that felt human when it mattered.

---

## The Solution: Sagentics Built an Agentic Platform

Sagentics developed a fully agentic eCommerce platform for MerchLab that puts intelligent autonomous agents at the centre of key workflows. The goal was simple: deliver enterprise-grade automation to every growing business, so MerchLab could scale without increasing cost or complexity.

## What We Delivered

### 1. Agentic Customer Support Across Three Channels

Sagentics designed and implemented a unified AI support system that handles customer conversations on **WhatsApp**, **email**, and **voice** from a single shared AI engine.

- **WhatsApp:** Customers get instant, 24/7 replies. The AI (persona "Mia") can look up order status, send quotes and invoices as PDFs, track delivery, answer policy questions from a knowledge base, and escalate to a human when needed. Staff can take over any conversation from a live dashboard and hand control back to the AI at any time, with full message history preserved.

- **Email:** Incoming emails are polled, filtered, and categorised automatically. The same AI engine drafts professional, contextual replies and sends them (including PDF attachments when relevant). The flow is fully automated with no human review step; escalation is the only handover point.

- **Voice:** Outbound and inbound calls are handled by a voice AI that uses the same order, quote, invoice, and knowledge base capabilities. During a call, the system can send WhatsApp messages and documents to the customer. When the AI cannot resolve an issue, it triggers an escalation email to staff so a human can follow up.

All three channels share one conversation memory and one set of capabilities: order status, quote and invoice lookup, customer account info, delivery tracking, knowledge base search, and escalate to human. The result is consistent, accurate support regardless of how the customer reaches out.

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop Where It Matters

On WhatsApp, Sagentics implemented explicit human/AI handover so that MerchLab staff stay in control when it counts:

- **Take Over:** From the dashboard, staff can pause the AI and reply to the customer directly. All messages stream in real time.
- **Hand Back:** When the issue is resolved, staff hand the conversation back to the AI, which resumes automatically.
- **Escalation:** When the AI detects that it cannot help or the customer asks for a person, it triggers an email to staff with conversation context so they can follow up personally.

This keeps the experience human when needed while keeping the bulk of routine queries automated.

### 3. Automation Beyond Support

The platform automates more than conversations:

- **Order management and fulfilment orchestration** so that orders flow through the right steps without manual triage.
- **On-demand branding and artwork handling** so customers can upload artwork, get auto-vectorisation, and complete branded orders in one flow.
- **Lead enrichment and intelligent sales generation** to help convert interest into orders.
- **Reporting and TAT management** from conversion to delivery so MerchLab can see performance and bottlenecks in one place.

Together, these automations reduce manual work and let the team focus on high-value tasks.

## The Outcome

- **24/7 customer service and operational support** without a proportional increase in support headcount.
- **Single AI engine** powering WhatsApp, email, and voice for consistent answers and one place to improve and extend.
- **Human control when it matters** via take-over, hand-back, and escalation so customers get a person when they need one.
- **Scalable, cost-efficient operations** so MerchLab can grow without adding cost or complexity at the same rate.
